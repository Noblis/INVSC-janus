 * \subsection about About
 * Intelligence analysts often rely on facial images to assist in establishing
 * the identity of an individual, but too often, just examining the sheer volume
 * of possibly relevant images and videos can be daunting. While biometric tools
 * like automated face recognition could assist analysts in this task, current
 * tools perform best on the well-posed, frontal facial photos taken for
 * identification purposes. IARPA’s Janus program aims to dramatically improve
 * the current performance of face recognition tools by fusing the rich spatial,
 * temporal, and contextual information available from the multiple views
 * captured by today’s “media in the wild”. The program will move beyond largely
 * two-dimensional image matching methods used currently into more model-based
 * matching that fuses all views from whatever video and stills are available.
 * Data volume now becomes an integral part of the solution instead of an
 * oppressive burden.
 *
 * The program is seeking to fund rigorous, high-quality research which uses
 * innovative and promising approaches drawn from a variety of fields to develop
 * novel representational models capable of encoding the shape, texture, and
 * dynamics of a face. Instead of relying on a “single best frame approach,”
 * these representations must address the challenges of Aging, Pose,
 * Illumination, and Expression (A-PIE) by exploiting all available imagery.
 * Technologies must support analysts working with partial information by
 * addressing the uncertainties which arise when working with possibly
 * incomplete, erroneous, and ambiguous data. The goal of the program is to test
 * and validate techniques which have the potential to significantly improve the
 * performance of biometric recognition in unconstrained imagery, to that end,
 * the program will involve empirical testing of recognition performance across
 * unconstrained videos, camera stills, and scanned photos exhibiting a broad
 * range of real-world imaging conditions.
 *
 * It is anticipated that successful teams will transcend conventional
 * approaches to biometric recognition by drawing on the multidisciplinary
 * expertise of researchers from the fields of pattern recognition and machine
 * learning; computer vision and image processing; computer graphics and
 * animation; mathematical statistics and modeling; and data visualization and
 * analytics.

 * Attributes collected for images in the Janus program were annotated using

 * Below are the instructions given to workers for each attribute, which should
 * act as a de-facto definition of the attribute.
 * In some cases instructions evolved slightly over time, reflecting lessons
 * learned from communicating with the workers.
 *
 * As implementations of the Janus API leverage divergent algorithms and data
 * sets, the precise semantics of each attribute may differ by implementation.
 *
 * \subsection face Face
 * [Instructions with images.]
 * (https://s3.amazonaws.com/TurkAnnotator/boundingboxesinstructions.html)
 *
 * We strongly prefer tight bounding boxes over loose ones.
 * There's a bit of leeway here, especially because it is also important to
 * capture the whole head, but if the bounding boxes are too loose we will have
 * to reject the work.
 * For the case of people wearing hats or headgear, or who just have large hair,
 * try to approximate where the head would be (it's alright if you're not
 * exact).
 * As a general rule of thumb, if you can see a feature on a face (an eye, nose,
 * or mouth) or if you can tell it's a forward facing head (but it's too far
 * away to make out individual features), box it!
 * Please err on the side of boxing heads, the exceptions being heads that are
 * completely facing away and heads that are blocked so you cannot see any
 * features.
 * It's okay if boxes overlap!
 * But, try to only box the parts of the head you can see.
 * Non-living faces (portraits, faces on screens, etc.) are fair game, too!
 * If they look realistic, box them.
 * We understand that some images aren't worth your time.
 * In the case of image shown below, where there are many small, blurry heads in
 * the background, just box the person in focus (or press "Not visible" if no
 * one is in focus).
 * In cases like this one, where many faces are distinguishable, please press
 * the "Crowd" button.
 * We ask that you only do this in cases where there truly are crowds - at least
 * 25 heads or so.
 * These images will definitely be reviewed, and wrongly pressing this button
 * will result in a rejection.
 *
 * \subsection right_eye Right Eye
 * For this task, click on the middle of the right eye of the subject shown.
 * Please note that the right eye of the subject will usually appear on the
 * left.
 * Also note that the middle of the eye is not necessarily the pupil,
 * but rather the midpoint between outer edges of the eye.
 * If the right eye is not visible or too blurry to identify, press
 * "Not Visible" - unless the eye is obscured by dark glasses, in which case we
 * ask that you estimate where the eye would be.
 *
 * \subsection left_eye Left Eye
 * For this task, click on the middle of the left eye of the subject shown.
 * Please note that the left eye of the subject will usually appear on the
 * right.
 * Also note that the middle of the eye is not necessarily the pupil,
 * but rather the midpoint between outer edges of the eye.
 * If the left eye is not visible or too blurry to identify, press
 * "Not Visible" - unless the eye is obscured by dark glasses, in which case we
 * ask that you estimate where the eye would be.
 *
 * \subsection nose_base Nose Base
 * For this task, click on the middle of the nose base of the subject shown.
 * This is considered to be the middle of where the nose meets the face.
 * If the nose base is not visible or too blurry to identify, press
 * "Not Visible”.
 *
 * \subsection forehead_visible Forehead Occlusion
 * For this task, choose "Forehead Covered" when:
 * - A scarf, hat, or hair covers at least 25% of the area between eyebrows
 *   and hairline.
 * - The area of the forehead is not contained in the image (because the
 *   edge of the image cuts off this area).
 * Choose "Not Covered" when:
 * - More than 75% of the area between eyebrows and hairline is visible.
 * - Another part of the person's face is blocking part of the forehead
 *   (e.g. the person's face is tilted upwards or to the side).
 * - The image is too blurry to see the forehead region well.
 *
 * \subsection eyes_visible Eye Occlusion
 * For this task, choose "Eyes Covered" when:
 * - Something is in front of either eye. This will often be glasses
 *   (even clear glasses) or hair, but can be anything in the image.
 * - The eye area is not contained in the image.
 * Choose "Not Covered" when:
 * - Both eyes are uncovered (even if they are closed).
 * - Another part of the person's face is blocking either eye
 *   (e.g. the person's face is tilted upwards or turned to the side).
 * - The image is too blurry to see the eye region well
 *
 * \subsection nose_mouth_visible Nose and Mouth Occlusion
 * For this task, choose "Covered" when:
 * - Something is in front of the nose or the mouth, or both.
 *   This is often a microphone or a hand, but can be anything in the image.
 *   If any type of glasses are over the lower part of the nose, this should be
 *   marked as "covered."
 * - The area of the nose and mouth is not contained in the image
 *   (the edge of the image cuts off this area).
 * Choose "Not Covered" when:
 * - Both the nose and mouth are uncovered (facial hair is not considered
 *   'covering').
 * - Another part of the person's face is blocking the nose or mouth
 *   (e.g. the person's face is tilted downwards or turned to the side).
 * - The image is too blurry to see the nose and mouth region well.
 *
 * \subsection indoor Indoor or Outdoor
 * For this task, choose "Indoor" when:
 * - The scene appears to be indoors, and is inside a building or other
 *   covered structure, including any vehicle with a roof.
 * - The scene might be indoors or outdoors, and there seems to be artificial
 *   light present.
 * Choose "Outdoor" when:
 * - The scene appears to be outdoors, and is not under a roof or inside a
 *   building, vehicle or structure.
 * - The scene might be indoors or outdoors, and the photo appears to have
 *   only natural light (sunlight).
 *
 * \subsection age Age
 * For this task, estimate the approximate age of the person shown.
 * The age categories in years and corresponding values in the #janus_metadata
 * , are:
 *
 * | 0 - 19 | 20 - 34 | 35 - 49 | 50-64 | 65+ | Unknown |
 * |--------|---------|---------|-------|-----|---------|
 * | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4     | 5   | 0       |
 *
 * If image quality is low, please take your best guess.
 *
 * \subsection skin_tone Skin Tone
 * Skin tone is generalized into 6 categories described below, along with
 * their corresponding values in the #janus_metadata.
 *
 * | Light Pink | Light Yellow | Medium Pink/Brown | Medium Yellow/Brown | Medium-Dark Brown | Dark Brown |
 * |------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
 * | 1          | 2            | 3                 | 4                   | 5                 | 6          |
 *
 * \subsection facial_hair Facial Hair
 * For this task, there are four possible types of facial hair.  Select the facial hair type that is closest to the description below.
 * | No Facial Hair | Moustache | Goatee | Beard |
 * |----------------|-----------|--------|-------|
 * | 0              | 1         | 2      | 3     |
